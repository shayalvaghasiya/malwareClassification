FOUR datasets:
 
API_functions, DLLs_imported, PE_header, PE_section

-> THis four datasets provides information about the same malware files from different angles. 

-> All dataset has 2 column in common to identify malware and its type.
    SHA256 (hash value to identify file), TYPE

-> 7 types of malware
    0=Benign (safe)
    1=RedLineStealer 
    2= Downloader 
    3=RAT 
    4=BankingTrojan 
    5=SnakeKeyLogger 
    6=Spyware 

API_Functions: (29505 rows × 21920 columns)
    dataset of api functions used by malware

 -> 21918 columns are api_function, that shows which functions are called by which malware


DLL_imported: (29498 rows × 631 columns)
    dataset of DLLs used by malwares.

-> 629 columns are dll files name to show which dll file is used by a particular malware


PE_header: (29807 rows × 54 columns)
    dataset of information about malware file

-> 52 columns contains values of PE header


PE_sections: (29760 rows × 92 columns)
    information about malware sections

-> 90 columns having prefix (text, data, rdata, bss, idata, edata, rsrc, reloc, tls, pdata) are 10 sections of PE file having 9 info fields each.
